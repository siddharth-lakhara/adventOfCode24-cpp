# Advent Of code 24 - CPP Edition
I'm trying to get back to doing competitive programming in C++. \n
I used to code regularly in C++ in college, however moved to java, as it easier to work with \n
This repo contains my solutions to advent-of-code challenges for the year 2024, in c++

## Commands
$ g++ day1/day1.cpp -o day1.out
$ ./day1.out < example.input
